Cauliflower and Weed Detection using Semantic Segmentation.
Crop Segmentation is an important task in Precision agriculture, where the use of aerial robots with an onboard camera has been contributed to the development of new solution alternatives. We address the problem of cauliflower plant segmentation in top-view RGB images of a crop grown under open-field difficult circumstances of complete lighting conditions and non-ideal crop maintenance practices defined by local farmers. We present a U-net Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with an encoder-decoder that classify each pixel as cauliflower, weed and background using only raw color images as input. Our approach achieves a mean training accuracy of 96%  and validation accuracy of 93% despite the complexity of background. For further detailed report please refer to Project Refort file.
